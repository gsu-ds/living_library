##  Development Environment

This project uses [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to ensure a consistent, reproducible development setup.

### Quick Start

1. **Open in Codespaces**  
   Click the green **Code** button on this repository, then choose **Open with Codespaces** → **New codespace**.

2. **Automatic setup**  
   The dev container will automatically install Python and all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Activate the environment**  
   When your Codespace starts, you’re ready to run scripts and notebooks immediately.
